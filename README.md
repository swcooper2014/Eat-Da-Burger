# Eat-Da-Burger

A fun app that lets a user input the name of a burger they want to eat.
Once submitted, the burger is displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Every burger entered is stored in the database.
